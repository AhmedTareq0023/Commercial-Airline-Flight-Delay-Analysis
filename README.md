# Commercial-Airline-Flight-Delay-Analysis
This project uses Power BI to analyze and focuses on the exploration and visualization of flight delay data. By leveraging Power BI's capabilities, we aim to provide insights into the factors contributing to flight delays, patterns over time, and potential correlations among various variables.
# Data Source
The analysis is based on a comprehensive dataset containing information on flight schedules, actual departure and arrival times, reasons for delays, and other relevant parameters. Ensure that the dataset is properly formatted and loaded into Power BI for accurate analysis.
# Key Visualizations
- Flight Delay Overview A dashboard presenting an overview of flight delays, including the total number of delayed flights, average delay duration, and distribution of delays by airline.
- Delay Trends Over Time Time-series visualizations showing the variation in flight delays over different time intervals (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly). Identify peak delay periods and potential seasonality.
- Delay Causes A breakdown of delay causes (e.g., weather, technical issues, air traffic) to understand the primary factors contributing to delays. Use visuals like pie charts or stacked bar charts to represent the - distribution.
- Airport Analysis Visualizations highlighting airports with the highest frequency and duration of delays. Consider geospatial visualizations to show delays on a map.
- Airline Performance Comparative analysis of airlines based on their delay statistics. Utilize visuals like bar charts and tables to display performance metrics for each airline.
- alot of slicers to make easly reading of data

  # USING DAX
  I make alot of measure to show it through card or any chart in Pages.
  # USING POWER QUERY
  I merged the three csv files into only one sheet (Table) with handling All Data with Flight Date (Year, Month, Day)
  and I make a Huge Applied Steps For Cleaning Data.
